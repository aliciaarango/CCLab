                In the year 3000 A.D., pollution has devastated the earth and botanical life has all but vanished. Lumiflora Cavae, the last surviving flower species, was first discovered deep within New Zealand's Waitomo Caves by Dr. Elysia Thorne while on a research expedition. Gently rotating and oscillating to purify its low oxygen environment, the flower emits a luminous glow due to a mutation with the DNA of glow worms. Despite initial joy at its discovery, attempts to transplant or cultivate the flower have thus far failed tragically due to its extreme sensitivity to foreign pathogens introduced by human touch. Upon contact, pollen immediately disperses into the air. This pollen holds unique significance as it carries the life energy of the flower itself. The red pollen signifies infection via human contact, while white pollen denotes untainted, healthy energy pollen. Once contaminated, Lumiflora Cavae's fate hangs by a delicate thread. Without swift intervention to cleanse it of the tainted red pollen, its demise is fixed. Thus, the quest to safeguard this botanical marvel is not only a race against time but a battle against the touch of humanity itself.

                <span class="yellow"> Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span>
                As human contact is lethal to Lumiflora Cavae, one should avoid touching the flower at all costs. If touched, swiftly eliminate any and all red pollen before time runs out. Remember, once dead, humanityâ€™s last hope for botanical resurgence will have vanished alongside it, so choose wisely on how to proceed if you encounter this flower.
